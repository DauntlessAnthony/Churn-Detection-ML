# Churn-Detection-ML
In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. By diving deep into the data, I uncovered patterns, correlations, and potential outliers that helped me make informed decisions during the modeling process.

To further enhance the predictive power of the models, I also conducted feature engineering. This involved  transforming existing ones( One Hot Encoding using Pd.get_dummies) to capture meaningful information and improve the performance of the churn detection system.

Using the knowledge gained from EDA and the engineered features, I trained and evaluated four models: logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, and SGD classifier. Each of these models contributes to the accuracy and effectiveness of the churn detection system in its own unique way.

To share my findings and code, I created a repository where you can find the EDA process, feature engineering techniques, and the implementation of these models. I'm excited to showcase the power of supervised machine learning, EDA, and feature engineering in churn detection.

Feel free to check out the repository, provide feedback, and collaborate. Let's work together to improve churn detection and customer retention strategies! 🚀📊👩‍💻
